##### Different sections:
# This .yml file has 3 main sections: first-join, join and quit.
# If one of those sections is missing, it won't send any message of that type.
# - "first-join" section: Send messages when a player joins for the first time.
# - "join" section: Send messages when a player joins normally.
# - "quit" section: Send messages when a player leaves the server unu.

##### Inside a Group Section:
# You can add a lot of custom groups with a different number OR custom name.
# Example:
# join: # "join" section, you can add groups in every section tho
#   1: # custom group
#   ------- # we'll see the nodes of every group later
#   myGroup: # custom group with a name lol
#   ------- # we'll see the nodes of every group later

##### A lot of Group nodes:
# Each node represents a different functionality. These nodes can be:
# - "permission:" Defines the permission of that group. Deleting this will
#                 categorize that group for all people in the server.
#                 You can choose between DEFAULT or a custom permission.
# - "priority:" Defines the priority between different custom permissions, if the
#               permission is DEFAULT, it won't take any effect on priority.
#               Deleting this will set the priority 0 or 1 (if DEFAULT or custom)
# - "sound:" Plays a sound defined by this node. Deleting this won't play a sound.
#            Keep in mind that sounds are different in most of the major version
#            of Minecraft. Check these links for more info:

#              WARNING!!: You can't put this node on the "quit" section.
# - "invulnerable:" Gives invulnerability for X seconds to the player when joins.
#                   Deleting this or setting it to 0 will disable this option.
#                   WARNING!!: You can't put this node on the "quit" section.
# - "spawn:" Teleports the player to the world and respective locations.
#            Deleting this or the world set isn't a valid loaded world, it will
#            not teleport the player to any place.
#            WARNING!!: You can't put this node on the "quit" section.
# - "commands:" Execute commands when a player joins/leaves the server.
#               Deleting this won't execute any commands.
#               Using [PLAYER] first will execute a command as the player.
#               Else will execute the command as the console.
#               WARNING!!: You can't use [PLAYER] prefix on the quit section.

##### Types of messages:
# - Action Bar: Sends a message to the action bar. For some reason RGB colors
#               doesn't work in this type of message, rlly don't know why
#               WARNING!!: This type should only be 1 per group, more of that
#               it will replace the one before.
#               Put "[ACTION-BAR]" first on the message to select this type.
# - Title: Send a message like a title with/without subtitle using a line
#          separator for it (located in config.yml)
#          WARNING!!: This type should only be 1 per group, more of that it will
#          replace the one before.
#          Put "[TITLE]" first on the message to select this type.
# - Chat: Default one, send message to the chat. You can add all the lines you
#         want to send multiple chat messages.
# - JSON Msg: Use this type of message for Hover and Click events. Do not forget
#             that this type of message has its own format. Generate a JSON msg
#             with this link: https://minecraft.tools/en/json_text.php
#             Put "[JSON]" first on the message to select this type.

#           group, the private ones will override the public ones for that player.
